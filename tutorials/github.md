The advantages on using GitHub for your website or wiki:

* Other people can make changes to your Markdown files and help extend the wiki
* You still can review changes first and decide whether or not to accept those changes (which are called _pull request_ in GitHub terms)
* The whole service is free
* Hosting is fast and reliable
* You can optionally use your own domain
